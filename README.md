# Path2Zero
- Our platform provides a secure and transparent system to authenticate, trade, and permanently retire verified carbon credits — turning carbon offsets into provable climate action, not unchecked claims.
We address one of the most critical failures of today’s carbon markets: opacity and double counting. By digitally validating carbon credit certificates, enforcing identity verification, and maintaining an auditable record of every transaction, we ensure accountability from upload to retirement.
By unifying certificate authentication, a verified marketplace, and end-to-end traceability, we transform carbon credits into a credible, accountable, and data-driven instrument for real climate-resilient impact.
